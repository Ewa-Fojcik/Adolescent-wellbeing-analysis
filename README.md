#   Adolescent Wellbeing Analysis

This repository contains the data and analysis code for my undergraduate dissertation, "Factors Contributing to Adolescent Wellbeing: A Comprehensive Investigation." This project showcases my skills in data analysis, statistical modeling, and data interpretation.

##   Overview

This study is a data-driven investigation into the factors influencing adolescent wellbeing. It leverages a dataset of 478 students aged 11-17 who participated in the Dame Kelly Holmes Trust's 2021 and 2022 programmes. As a data analyst project, it focuses on the application of statistical methods to explore the impact of variables such as self-assessment, gender, and neighbourhood deprivation on adolescent wellbeing.

##   Methodology

This project employed a rigorous data analysis approach, utilizing an objective interpretative strategy and a pre-post intervention design. Data was sourced from questionnaires, including the Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Health Wellbeing Scale (SWEMBS) and the Stirling Children's Wellbeing Scale (SCWBS), alongside demographic information and self-assessment statements. The core analytical technique was multiple linear regression. Data management and analysis were conducted using industry-standard tools.

##   Key Findings

The analysis revealed several key insights:

* Gender differences in self-assessment and wellbeing scales were observed, with males generally reporting higher scores than females.
* The analysis quantified the negative impact of neighbourhood deprivation on adolescents' communication skills, self-satisfaction, and sense of community.
* Despite these challenges, the analysis also highlighted the resilience of the participants, with the majority reporting positive self-perceptions and optimism about their futures.
